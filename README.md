This is a sample project, build using MVP (Model View presenter architecture)

I have used following open source libraries 

1) Retrofit (For all HTTP api requests)
2) Glide (Image loading and display in Image views)
3) GestureImageView (To show an Image in full screen with pinch zoon in and zoom out)
4) Gson (for JSON object mapping with POJO)
5) Timber (small tool for logging, this is kind of Android Log on steroids)
